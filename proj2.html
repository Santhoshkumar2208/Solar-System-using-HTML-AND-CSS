                <h2 id="Sun">SUN</h2>
                <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by far its largest object, containing more than 99% of the system’s total mass. It is a huge ball of hot gases, mainly hydrogen and helium, and produces light and heat through nuclear fusion in its core. The Sun’s energy is essential for life on Earth, driving climate, weather, and photosynthesis in plants. It also holds the planets, moons, comets, and asteroids in their orbits through its strong gravitational pull.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Mercury">MERCURY</h2>
                <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. Its surface is rocky and covered with craters, similar to the Moon. Temperatures vary extremely, being very hot during the day and freezing at night due to the almost nonexistent atmosphere. Mercury has no air or water and cannot support life, making it a harsh and desolate world.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Venus">VENUS</h2>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's twin because it is similar in size and structure. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide, causing a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it extremely hot. The surface is rocky with mountains and volcanoes, and its clouds contain sulfuric acid, making it one of the most hostile planets in the Solar System.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Earth">EARTH</h2>
                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet known to support life. About 70% of its surface is covered with water, and the rest is land consisting of continents and islands. The atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, providing the air necessary for humans, animals, and plants to survive. Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, and features a balanced climate that sustains a wide variety of life.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Mars">MARS</h2>
                <p>Mars, known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide on its surface. Mars has polar ice caps, enormous volcanoes, and deep canyons. The atmosphere is thin and mostly carbon dioxide, making it very cold and dry. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and scientists believe that water may have existed on its surface in the past.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Jupiter">JUPITER</h2>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant made mainly of hydrogen and helium and has a very thick atmosphere. Jupiter is famous for the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has lasted for centuries. The planet has more than seventy moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System. Jupiter also has faint rings surrounding it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Saturn">SATURN</h2>
               <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is well-known for its magnificent rings made of ice and rock particles. It is a gas giant like Jupiter and has a mostly hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Saturn has over eighty moons, including Titan, which is larger than Mercury. Its rings and moons make it one of the most beautiful and intriguing planets in the Solar System.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Uranus">URANUS</h2>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is well-known for its magnificent rings made of ice and rock particles. It is a gas giant like Jupiter and has a mostly hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Saturn has over eighty moons, including Titan, which is larger than Mercury. Its rings and moons make it one of the most beautiful and intriguing planets in the Solar System.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Neptune">NEPTUNE</h2>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet in the Solar System. It is an ice giant with a deep blue color and the fastest winds among all planets. Neptune has fourteen known moons, including Triton, which is geologically active. The planet also has faint rings and a very cold atmosphere. Its distance from the Sun makes it one of the most remote and least explored planets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2 id="Pluto">PLUTO</h2>
                <p>Pluto, now classified as a dwarf planet, is located in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune. It is small, icy, and rocky with a very thin atmosphere. Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest. Although it is distant and cold, it remains important for understanding the outer regions of the Solar System and the history of planetary formation.</p>

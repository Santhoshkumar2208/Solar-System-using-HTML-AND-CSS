# Solar-System-using-HTML-AND-CSS
An interactive Solar System simulation built using HTML and CSS. Planets revolve around the Sun using CSS keyframe animations, and hovering over each planet name displays a short description with smooth fade-in transitions. The project demonstrates CSS animations, positioning, and interactive UI effects.
